NOTE: I forked github.com/smabie/stag after it failed to compile, probably
because it hasn't been updated in over 10 years. Fixing the compilation error
turned out to be just a matter of adding a library and changing one CFLAG in
the Makefile. Now I want to make some improvements.

stag is a C curses based mp3/ogg/flac tagging application. 

Features:
    * Support for MP3, OGG, and FLAC files
    * Full utf8 support
    * Support for simultaneous file editing
    * File selection by regex
    * Very low memory footprint (~2MB unless editing many files)
    * Uses the very fast Taglib library
    * Intuitive curses interface
    * Released into the public domain 

Dependencies:
    * ncurses (probably included with your distribution)
    * taglib (sometimes called libtag) 

Planned features:
    * DONE: Help screen
    * Show file path in info window
    * Use a custom set of tags
    * DONE: Hide cursor in directory and file modes
    * Load argv[1] instead of cwd
    * Command line option to prevent scanning directory
    * Sort files before adding? or at least sort the files in each directory added
    * Allow reordering in file window

Check out INSTALL for installation instructions. Check out the man
page for usage info.
