NOTE: I forked github.com/smabie/stag after it failed to compile, probably
because it hasn't been updated in over 10 years. My intention is to update the
code enough so that it compiles without changing any functionality.

stag is a C curses based mp3/ogg/flac tagging application. 

Features:
    * Support for MP3, OGG, and FLAC files
    * Full utf8 support
    * Support for simultaneous file editing
    * File selection by regex
    * Very low memory footprint (~2MB unless editing many files)
    * Uses the very fast Taglib library
    * Intuitive curses interface
    * Released into the public domain 

Dependencies:
    * ncurses (probably included with your distribution)
    * taglib (sometimes called libtag) 

Check out INSTALL for installation instructions. Check out the man
page for usage info.
